                        Notes: I submitted this talk's title as "Feedback Loops at Work" but it could just as well be called
                        "How to Taste Your Code as you build" because of all the food talk I've managed to slip in this, you'll see in a minute...

                        What's the best sandwich you can make _for them_?

                        <!-- TODO: improve this question, more impact -->

                        Notes: what I described there in an arguably contrived way is two types of feedback loops.
                        One of them led to a quick, cheap, positive conclusion where customer's expectations were
                        met relatively quickly and cheaply, and another one where things didn't go as well.

                        ## What is a feedback loop?

                        A feedback loop is a cyclical process of acting, checking results against a goal, and adjusting actions until the goal is reached or a desired state is maintained.

                        ## Feedback loops at work

                        - TDD
                        - Debugging
                        - Scrum sprints (inspect and adapt)
                        - A performance review at work
                        - CI/CD

                        Note:
                        Ask the audience to name a few examples of feedback loops in software engineering.
                        Say it like this: Scrum sprints? that’s a feedback loop, roadmaps? a feedback loop, CI/CD? all about the loops. Almost everything works in loops.

                        ## Are all loops good?

                        Bad feedback loops:

                        - A misconfigured API request retry mechanism <!-- When you don't implement back-off algorithms, max retries, no short-circuiting, and end up overwhelming upstream services -->
                        - A project in Death March
                        - Goodhart's Law
                        - Wanting to punch ChatGPT after it tried to gaslight you for the 5th time in the same convo

                        Notes:
                        Ask audience if they can think of any examples of bad feedback loops
                        When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

                        Notes:
                        Anyway, let's go back to the good loops, let's talk about fun loops!
                        show of hands who played Hot Wheels or similar game as a kid.
                        If you didn't play yourself but have bought your own kids a Hot Wheels set, that counts too.
                        The idea is we want more of these loops. But why? Why not just go in a straight line?

                        ## Failing Fast

                        ![](img/zuck.jpg)

                        Notes:
                            Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster.
                            However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they're
                            more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by
                            moving too slowly. We have a saying: 'Move fast and break
                            things.' The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably
                            not moving fast enough.
                            If there is an issue, your quickest, tightest, smallest loops may not catch it in its entirety (as its implications could be broad), but you may catch a bit of it: enough to signal there’s trouble afoot. So you iron out the problem without having to go to the bigger loops yet. And when you do, you do your bigger loops next, to make sure you removed all of the problem, not just the small bit your tightest loop was able to identify
                        ---
                        ## More loops, tighter, faster!

                        Get as many loops in place as you can, and tighten them up so you can go round them as fast as possible!

                        Notes:
                        This doesn’t mean rush through things, but to make small, constant adjustments through small iterations.

                        ## Tasting as we cook

                        [Illustration of improved diagram]

                        Notes:
                        Bringing back the sandwich cook analogy from earlier, I've not gone to cooking school but I've watched loads
                        of Masterchef, and one of the first things they teach you is to always taste your food as you make it.
                        Because a lot of errors are much quicker and cheaper to correct early on. Building software
                        is not the same as cooking, as much as I'd love it to be, but there are parallels.
                        I believe there are plenty of ways to "taste our software" as we build it. Let me show you how.
                        Now I'm sure many of the techniques and ideas I'll talk about now many of you already do. Consider this a comprehensive checklist of ways to tighten your loops.

                        Notes:
                        The first thing you can do to shorten your iterations is to actually turn the entire cycle on its head
                        and optimise at the very beginning. The best kind of work is the work you don't have to do.
                        How do you save yourself some cycles through the loop?

                        ## Unit tests

                        - TDD
                        - Hot reloading
                        - Watch mode (tip: use `watchexec` to emulate this if your test suite doesn't support it)
                        - Fast unit tests

                        Notes: if running your full unit test suite takes more than a few seconds, they're not fast
                        ---
                        ## Manual testing in local dev environment

                        - Do it less by writing more automated tests if you can
                        - Live reloading
                        - Aim to have a repeatable, automated environment & data setup process, e.g. Docker, minikube, etc.
                        ---
                        ## Code & architecture reviews

                        - Pair & ensemble programming
                        - Whiteboarding
                        - Produce documentation from code automatically

                        - Build on PR / push
                        - A fast pipeline
                        - Trunk-based development
                        - Feature toggles
                        - Contract testing

                        ## UAT & Internal Demos

                        - Show progress to stakeholders and obtain feedback regularly (once a week, more often if you can!)
                        - Ask people to use your system and watch them while they do it
                        - Dogfooding

                        Notes:
                        If they get confused or ask questions, that's a bug.

                        - Canary releases
                        - Dual running, shadow launches
                        - Feature toggles
                        - A/B testing

                        Notes: do you need to do all of these? No, not really. Not all of these will apply to every use case, of course (e.g. asking for user feedback is harder when you're building a data analytics pipeline, for example).

                        ## Beyond feedback loops

                        Everything is an experiment
                        ---
                        ## Experimenting

                        1. Come up with a hypothesis
                        2. Build the bare minimum you can to prove it
                        3. Measure response, obtain feedback
                        4. Learn, adjust, repeat

                        Allows us to be scientific, data-driven

                        Notes:
                        Hypothesis: I believe this product/feature/service will solve this problem or make someone else’s life or work better in this way
                        ---
