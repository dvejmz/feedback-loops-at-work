                        ## What is a feedback loop?

                        A feedback loop is a cyclical process of acting, checking results against a goal, and adjusting actions until the goal is reached or state is maintained indefinitely.

                        ## Feedback loops at work

                        - TDD
                        - Debugging
                        - Scrum sprints (inspect and adapt)
                        - A performance review at work
                        - CI/CD

                        Note:
                        Ask the audience to name a few examples of feedback loops in software engineering.
                        Say it like this: Scrum sprints? that’s a feedback loop, roadmaps? a feedback loop, CI/CD? all about the loops. Almost everything works in loops.

                        Notes:
                            Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster.
                            However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they're
                            more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by
                            moving too slowly. We have a saying: 'Move fast and break
                            things.' The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably
                            not moving fast enough.
                            If there is an issue, your quickest, tightest, smallest loops may not catch it in its entirety (as its implications could be broad), but you may catch a bit of it: enough to signal there’s trouble afoot. So you iron out the problem without having to go to the bigger loops yet. And when you do, you do your bigger loops next, to make sure you removed all of the problem, not just the small bit your tightest loop was able to identify

                        ## More loops, tighter, faster!

                        Get as many loops in place as you can, and tighten them up so you can go round them as fast as possible!

                        Notes:
                        This doesn’t mean rush through things, but to make small, constant adjustments through small iterations.

                        ## Beyond feedback loops

                        Treat everything like an experiment
                        ---
                        ## Experimenting

                        1. Come up with a hypothesis to bootstrap your loop: I believe this product/feature/service will solve this problem or make someone else’s life or work better in this way
                        2. Build the bare minimum you can to prove it
                        3. Measure response, collect feedback
                        4. Learn from it, adapt, and off you go again round the loop!

                        Allows us to be scientific, data-driven
